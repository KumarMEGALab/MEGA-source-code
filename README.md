# MEGA-source-code
The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software is developed with the goal of providing a biologist centric, integrated suite of tools for statistical analyses of DNA and protein sequence data from an evolutionary standpoint. MEGA includes tools for sequence alignment, best-fit model selection, phylogenetic tree reconstruction and visualization, testing an array of evolutionary hypotheses, estimating sequence divergences, web-based acquisition of sequence data, estimating divergence times, predicting ancestral sequences, diagnosing disease mutations, and expert systems to generate natural language descriptions of the analysis methods and data chosen by the user.
