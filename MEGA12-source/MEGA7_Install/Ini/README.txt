Do NOT modify the Settings.ini file in this directory. It is needed by
the InnoSetup installer for the case where users opt in to usage statistics
collection. If the user opts in, this file gets copied to the app data directory.
If not, a different version of the file that turns off data collection is extracted
from compiled resources by MEGA and copied to the app data directory.
